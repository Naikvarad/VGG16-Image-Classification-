# VGG16-Image-Classification-
This repository contains an implementation of image classification using the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. 
VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman from the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It is widely used for image classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

Usage
Dataset Preparation: Ensure your dataset is organized properly. The model expects the dataset to be organized into separate folders for each class.

Model Training: Train the VGG16 model using the provided script. You can fine-tune the model on your dataset or train from scratch depending on your requirements.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be provided.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (Optional)
